This JOSM paint style was created for beginner JOSM training on Missing maps mapathons and it is part of this [JOSM preset for beginner training](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fG1qrFkMbpK-SyBo_iTy9lGt4mtZMqUA?usp=share_link) that can also be reached as "[https://bit.ly/JOSM23](https://bit.ly/JOSM23)".

**This paint style is based on "[Inline_Validation](https://github.com/osmlab/appledata)" and "[Missing Maps / Youth Mappers Validators Checks](https://github.com/MissingMaps/josm_styles)" paint styles.** The difference is, that this paint style is showing warnings for issues only made by the user itself so the newcomer won't get overwhelmed.

This paint style highlights: 
- Overlapping buildings
- Building inside building
- Buildings with shared nodes
- Building connected to highway
- Buildings tagged differently then building=yes

The user can toggle on Slovak translation of the warnings by right clicking on the paint style -> Style settings -> Slovenčina. To toggle back the english warnings just repeat the process to uncheck Slovenčina.
